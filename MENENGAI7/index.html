        <u>THE MEGA INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF PASTORS</u>
    </h2>

<u>
    Daniel 2:44-45
</u>
</p>
<p><u>1st Corintians 15: 24-25: </u>
    He says that God Almighty has promised that the Kingdom must come;
    I rather join the winning side since all the other Kingdoms will fall and only the kingdom of God will remain
</p>
<p><u>1st Thessalonians 4:13-18: </u>
    He says that God does not like ignorant believers
    How they conduct their lives must be vividly different from those who live in the world
    The Lord God almighty wants to talk about the rapture of the church to exclusive group of people - 'hermanos y hermanas'(brothers and sisters)
    The rapture is not for everybody - the church separated from the world - their lifestyle must be different from the world
    The rapture is only for those who are born again
    however much the church is fallen they must be restored
    14;  the Lord wants to talk about the rapture to the church, 
    only the promise of ressurection(the power of the gospel) can keep the church heavenly focused
    15; The authoritative words of God that will never fail - The Prophecy of the rapture is guaranteed to take place;
    he lays down the guarantee that that day will take place
    16; However to what extenct the church is fallen the Lord is not coming back to go to the cross; but as a victorious King with splendor
     - --- - -- -He is saying that run to the church and tell them that I am coming- -- - --- --
     He will come out of heaven as a triumphant King
    17; - He says that there is being caught up, there is the transportation, being cought up with the Lord 
    It is the Day of the Grand reunion; Are you ready to meet your maker?  - What report will you give God?
    - prepare to meet your maker - 
    And so shall we be with the Lord forever - the Lord makes a special invitation to a special group of people - these group of people are alraedy living with the Lord eternally
    these people dont care about public opinions
    outwardly we may be wasting away but inwardly building an eternal Kingdom 
    - A time has come where somebody has to draw a line and stand with Jesus
    18: you will not care about persecution - what encourages us in this Prophecy is that Jesus Crushed death therefore Stand with the Lord - He will recompense them
    - God prepares to reward faithfulness -  the epistles in revelation 2 & 3: 

    

</p>
<p><u>THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THOSE WHO FAIL TO ENTER</u>

</p>
<p><u>Mathew 24: 1-36</u> - <b>a prophecy that Jesus himself gave</b> 
    -As the disciples tried to get his attention towards the temple he says the magnificance of everything will be destroyed 
    - not even the Son of man will know - 
    4-35; He speaks about the second coming - a life that is not normal; earthquakes and distress
    but int the first coming people will be living normalydy knows the day or the about which nobo from 36;-> 
</p>
<p><u>Daniel 9:24-27: </u>
    - very soon the church will depart and there will be no church- if you are the church just prepare for departure - the church age is about to come to an end
    The church age shows the long suffering of God
</p>
<p><u>Genesis 15:13-14: </u>
    
</p>
<p><u>Jeremiah 25:8-12:</u>

</p>
<p><u>Revelation 12:6:</u>
    when God is dealing with Israel about the tribulation an exact number of days is given 1260days
    In his dealing with the  church he does not show the dates
</p>
<p><u>Mathew 21</u>
    
</p>
<p><u>Acts 1:7;</u>
    
</p>
<p><u>Titus 2:11-13;</u>
 When they slaugehtered the blameless lamb and smeared the blood on door posts the grace of God appeared
    
</p>
<p><u>1st John 3:2;</u>
    Eternity is still hidden- he does not give the date
</p>
<p><u>Phillipians 3:20-21;</u>
    but simmilarily in Mathew24, when the Lord wants to talk about glorification
    there are no two citizenships; the superiority of the Kingdom of heaven must be seen in you
    He does not give the date  - He made it this way so as to instruct how you live your life every day every hour, every minute, every second
</p>
<p><u>2nd Samuel 7:13-17;</u>
    The Prophet Nathan promises David a Glorious Throne
    therefore an anxiety in the heart of God the Father te Establish the Messiah eternely in the Throne as it was to be in the lineage David




<p><u>Mathew24:36; </u>
    - the day and the hour is not known
    
</p>
<p><u>1st Samuel 30:16; </u>
    -= He says that after they had looted the good things, and have brought those good goods they think that judah is far away, Danger is far away
    and they continued being in the celebratory mood, All over sudden danger Struck!, 
    He says the most dangerous time is thetime when there seems to be no signs of danger, the time that you think your danger is farthest that is the time that danger will strike
    Eating and drinking are made for self preservation in this normal life; they fill the sensuality of life; they characterize the life of here and now;

    
</p>

<p><u>2nd peter 3:3-8;</u>
    -= He says that living normaly encourages an earthly living;
     eating and drinking and marrying in this life, is life without a spiritual focus
     eating and drinking and marriying causes a man to focus on the life of here and now
     and not when the Rapture will strike;

</p>

<p><u>Jude1:21</u>
    The instruction on how you ought to wait for the Messiah
    The Lord is asking this Generation to go back to the Love of the Father in total holiness and righteousness; 
    He is asking the whole world to repent
    The meaning of Salvation is to save youu from fire

</p>
<p><u>Hebrews 9:28;</u>
    He is coming for those who wait for him
    Many evangelists have drifted to hell as a result of eating drinking and marrying
    The same God who blesses marriage raises a flag when it comes to entry
</p>
<p><u>Acts 1:7;</u>
    He has promised glorification
    the Moment you flee sin he is dtill with you as Joseph fleed sexual sin\
    -Lot; with Abraham they made choices and lot chose to go to Sodom and the people of Sodom were known to be great sinners
    the power of sin succed him in and he gave up her two daugheters; ;The Lord says consider those two situations(Joseph and Lot)
